## Neural Fuzzing: Software-Agnostic Line Coverage Improvement using

### AFL Fuzzing and Neural Networks pipeline
### Abstract
Debugging has a huge role in software development cycles. Fuzzing is an effective software testing technique to find bugs. Up to 50% of the development time is dedicated to writing test cases and get more unique crashes and code coverage, [2]. Real-world software are very complex, has massive size and multiple modules. Modern fuzzers are not very effective in exploring bugs that lie deeper in the execution and usually hit to a certain threshold where no new bugs are being discovered, [3].
In this paper, we present a combination of a Neural Network architecture and Fuzz testing that doesnâ€™t require any prior knowledge about the given software or its inputs. In order to maximize code coverage and find deeper bugs within the code, we take existing seeds generated by the AFL Fuzzer and mutate them to include new test-cases to the given software[4]. This system offers a better debug process with higher code coverage and deep bug exposure at the same given time compared to fuzzing alone.
